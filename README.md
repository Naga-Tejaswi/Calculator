# Calculator CLI App

A professional command-line calculator supporting basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

## What Was Done

- **Created a new folder** named `Calculator` for project organization.
- **Developed a Python script** (`calculator.py`) implementing a CLI calculator with:
  - Functions for each operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
  - Input validation and error handling
  - A user-friendly looped menu for repeated calculations
  - Clean, modular, and professional code structure
- **Added this README.md** to document usage, features, and implementation details.

## Features
- Simple CLI interface
- Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Input validation and error handling
- Modular code using functions

## Usage

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `Calculator` directory:
   ```sh
   cd "d:\Elevate labs\Calculator"
   ```
2. Run the calculator script:
   ```sh
   python calculator.py
   ```
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to perform calculations.
4. Select 'Exit' to quit the application.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## File Structure
- `calculator.py` : Main Python script for the calculator
- `README.md`     : This documentation file
